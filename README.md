# RobotLearning_Course
This course has 4 projects. Each project is running on Linux.
Sample code is provided, we need to fill in the code to make it work and have a good training/testing result.
Here is a list of content of each project:
- Project1: This project aims to demonstrate how classical machine learning methods can be used in robotics setting. In this project, we will be working on a navigation agent that navigates inside a simple 2D maze.
- Project2: This project aims to demonstrate how neural networks can be used in a robotics setting. We will continue using the 2D maze environment introduced in Project 1 and learn to navigate an agent to a goal. However, since neural networks can be more powerful models than the ones we had access to previously, we can afford to make some changes to the 2D maze environment and make the problem more difficult.  This project consists of three parts. You will be training a simple DNN policy in Part I and a CNN policy in Parts II and III.
- Project3: In this project, we are required to learn the forward dynamics of a simple three-link arm through deep learning. 
- Project4: In this project, we are required to use deep Q-learning to solve a cart pole balancing problem. You are required to implement the learning algorithm from scratch and no RL libraries are allowed.
